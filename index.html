        <p class="card-text">Can't we just talk? Can't we just talk?
          Talk about where we're goin'
          Before we get lost, let me out first
          Can't get what we want without knowin'
          I've never felt like this before
          I apologize if I'm movin' too far
          Can't we just talk? Can't we just talk?
          Figure out where we're goin'</p>
          <p class="card-text">[Verse 1]
            Yeah, started off right
            I can see it in your eyes
            I can tell that you're wantin' more
            What's been on your mind?
            There's no reason we should hide
            Tell me somethin' I ain't heard before</p>
            <p class="card-text">Oh, I've been dreamin' 'bout it
              And it's you I'm on
              So stop thinkin' 'bout it</p>
          <p class="card-text">
            Can't we just talk? Can't we just talk?
            Talk about where we're goin'
            Before we get lost, let me out first (Yeah)
            Can't get what we want without knowin' (No)
            I've never felt like this before
            I apologize if I'm movin' too far
            Can't we just talk? Can't we just talk?
            Figure out where we're goin'

            [Verse 2]
            Oh, nah
            Penthouse view, left some flowers in the room
            I'll make sure I leave the door unlocked
            Now I'm on the way, swear I won't be late
            I'll be there by five o'clock


            Oh, you've been dreamin' 'bout it
            And I'm what you want
            So stop thinkin' 'bout it
          </p>
